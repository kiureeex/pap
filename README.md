### 📊 **Inertial Hub Project - Data Acquisition and Processing**  

## 🌟 **General Description**  
This project captures and processes data from **inertial sensors** (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer), exporting them in **CSV format** for further analysis by healthcare professionals.  

It was developed as part of the **Professional Aptitude Test (PAP)** to assist in **movement analysis** for medical applications.

## 🛁 **How It Works**  

### **1️⃣ Data Acquisition**  
The **inertial hub** captures real-time movement data using the following sensors:  
- **Accelerometer** 📈 – Measures linear acceleration across three axes (X, Y, Z).  
- **Gyroscope** 🔄 – Measures angular velocity (rotation) across three axes.  
- **Magnetometer** 🪯 – Captures magnetic field variations.  

### **2️⃣ Data Export (CSV Format)**  
- The collected data is **structured and saved in CSV format** for easy processing.  
- The CSV file is compatible with **Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel, and MATLAB**.  
- Example CSV output:  

```csv
Timestamp, Acc_X, Acc_Y, Acc_Z, Gyro_X, Gyro_Y, Gyro_Z, Mag_X, Mag_Y, Mag_Z
12:30:01,  0.98, -0.02,  9.81,  0.01,  -0.02,   0.03,   30.2,  25.4,  45.1
12:30:02,  0.99, -0.03,  9.80,  0.02,  -0.01,   0.02,   30.1,  25.3,  45.0
```

### **3️⃣ Data Processing (Python Script)**  
- The CSV file is processed using **Python** to:  
  ✔ **Clean and normalize** the data.  
  ✔ **Structure it** for easy interpretation and visualization.  
  ✔ Enable further **statistical and graphical analysis**.
