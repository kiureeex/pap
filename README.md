**📊 Inertial Hub Project - Data Acquisition and Processing**

**🌟 General Description**

This project aims to capture and process data from inertial sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer), exporting them in CSV format for further analysis by healthcare professionals.

🚀 How It Works

📡 > **Data Acquisition:**

> The inertial hub captures data from the following sensors:

> Accelerometer: Measures linear acceleration across three axes.  
> Gyroscope: Measures angular velocity across three axes. 
> Magnetometer: Captures magnetic field information.

**💾 Data Export:**

The collected data is organized and exported in CSV format, ensuring compatibility and ease of analysis.

🛠️ > **Python Processing:**

> CSV file is processed by a Python script, transforming the data to facilitate analysis. The processing includes:
> Cleaning and normalizing the data.  
> Structuring the data for clear interpretation.

**🎯 Objective:**

Provide accurate and structured data to support healthcare professionals in analyzing body movements and behaviors.

**📝 How to Use:**

**Capture:** Start data acquisition using the inertial hub.
**Export:** Generate a CSV file with the captured data.
**Processing:** Run the Python script to transform the data.

**📬 Purpose:**

Developed as part of the Professional Aptitude Test (PAP).
